# ðŸ§© Integration Issues Tracker

Central repo to log, triage, and route issues across global integration teams.

- Use templates for consistency
- Tag issues with `team1`, `team2`, or `team3`
- Automate using GitHub Actions
- Monitor via GitHub Projects board (Kanban-style)

For project board setup: see `project_board.md`
